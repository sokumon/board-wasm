# Board

## Why build this 
I used to love this Google project called Jamboard.I hav
Its basically a whiteboard app which stores the whiteboard drawings inside of Google drive

Google in classic google fashion shut the project down

Thus, I want to recreate my version of it

## Feature i want to build
- A canvas to draw
- A toolbar to edit the drawing styles, shapes etc
- Saving or Downloading the work
- Make it work inside Frappe Drive cause Jamboard works inside of Google Drive

## Tech Stack 

#### (this is temporary and may change later )

- Frappe Framework (to do all the crud stuff)
- Vuejs Frontend 
- Maybe a wasm canvas to do the actual whiteboard
